First get the project into the sample state by using the following commands:

```shell
$ git reset --hard
$ git checkout task-custom-response
```

Once the task is complete, enter the Task ID: **html-response**

## CODING TASK
Over in the `Service Worker` script file, located at `public/js/sw/index.js`, alter the `Service Worker` so it responds with some HTML. It can be whatever HTML you want as long as it includes the class name, `a-winner-is-me`. 

Make sure the `Update on reload` option is selected in the Chrome developer tools on the `Application` tab so you can see your changes to the `Service Worker` upon page refresh.

  Set the `Content-Type` property of the `headers` to `text/html`:
    
  ```js
  self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
    event.respondWith(
      new Response('<p class="a-winner-is-me">Responding from the Service Worker with HTML.</p>', {
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'text/html'
        }
      })
    );
  });
  ```
